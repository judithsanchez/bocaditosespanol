# Project Brief

This is a Next.js 14 web application for analyzing Spanish song lyrics with AI-enriched tokens. It uses a modular pipeline to parse, identify tokens, detect slang, and provide grammatical insights. Data is stored in JSON files within docs/data, and server-side logic is handled through the app/api directory. The goal appears to be creating an interactive language-learning application that helps users deeply understand Spanish songs.
